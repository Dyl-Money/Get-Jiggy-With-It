# Get-Jiggy-With-It

Get Jiggy With It! is an Android jigsaw puzzle phone app made with Unity, where you make puzzles using your own photos. It was put together in 4 weeks for the first part of an introduction to Unity university project with the task being to make a 2D Unity game/app in a group of 4.

The Get Jiggy With It!.apk is located in the Get Jiggy With It! app folder.

The original music for the app was "Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing" by Macintosh Plus but it was changed to "Lazy Aftermoon" by FSM Team feat e s c p out of copyright concerns.
